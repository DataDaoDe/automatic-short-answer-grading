# Automatic Short Answer Grading in an Online Quiz System

## Abstract

This thesis researches the problem of Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) in order to build an automatic grading module for short-text responses.
This module is developed for an online Learning Management System (LMS) called Stembord. A Multi-layer Perceptron model is the best performing model based on the features
obtained during research. This research also informs the design and implementation of the short-answer grading module which is consequently integrated into an API
service and called by the Stembord application.
